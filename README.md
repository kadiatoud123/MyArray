# MyArray - Java Array Manipulation Library

## Overview
MyArray is a custom Java class that provides an easy-to-use framework for manipulating arrays of integers. Designed with flexibility and functionality in mind, it supports a wide range of operations, such as input validation, statistical calculations, resizing, and data manipulation. 

This project serves as a demonstration of object-oriented programming principles, complete with constructors, methods, and data encapsulation. It's ideal for anyone exploring Java programming or looking for a foundation to build more advanced array operations.

## Features
- **Input Validation**: Ensures elements are within a predefined range.
- **Statistics**: Automatically computes sum, average, min, and max of array elements.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Grow or shrink the array to fit your needs.
- **Customizable Input**: Accepts user input with defined bounds and sentinel values.
- **Manipulation Methods**: Insert values, remove the smallest element, and more.
- **Histogram Representation**: Visualize array contents with an asterisk-based histogram.

## Key Highlights
- Built-in error handling for invalid inputs.
- Multiple constructors to initialize arrays based on user requirements.
- Efficient computation and storage of array properties.

## How It Works
The MyArray class processes integers within a specified range (10 to 50 by default). Users can initialize arrays, input data, and perform operations while the class handles the heavy lifting of calculations and data management. 

## Applications
MyArray is perfect for educational purposes, small-scale data processing tasks, and as a starting point for more advanced array manipulation projects.

## Getting Started
To get started with MyArray, you can clone this repository and compile the `MyArray.java` file using any Java compiler.
